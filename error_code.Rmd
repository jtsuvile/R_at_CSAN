## Code with lots of errors
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Start with a clean environment (you can use the broom image on 
# RStudio or run rm(list=ls())

# Can you as a team figure out what went wrong in each of these?
# If you are someone who has previous coding experience, these are probably pretty simple for you. Please help me in making this a learning experience for your teammates (i.e. let them try their hand at solving these and offer support as needed but don't give ready answers)

# Q1
x < 1

# Q2
y <- 'a"
x <- y

# Q3 
y * 5

# Q4
vect1 <- c(1,2,3 1)

# Q5
vectl[1]

# Q6
vect2 <- rnorm(20, mean=0, st.dev=5)

# Q7
# NB: This one has more than one problem
for(i in 1:5{
  print("The number is", Ä±)
