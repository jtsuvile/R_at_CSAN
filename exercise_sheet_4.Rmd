## Learning goals

After completing these tasks, you will know how to run simple analyses in R. You will know how to test for normality of your data and know how to find relevant non-parametric tests if your data is not suitable for parametric tests. You will know how to construct formulae for regression analyses. You will have also tried running regression analyses and comparing regression model fits. New concepts: This session will not introduce new programming concepts. We will focus on translating what you already know about statistical analyses to R and implementing things we learned from the previous sessions.
