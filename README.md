# R for scientists

This is a website created to support a course I created, R for scientists. 
The course is aimed at researchers (PhD student or more senior), who currently run their statistical analyses in a program using point-and-click interface (such as SAS or SPSS) and who would like to learn R. 
There are a few versions of this course which I've used in different universities. 
This repo is for a course I ran at the Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience in Link√∂ping University in 2020.
The course website itself can be seen found at [https://jtsuvile.github.io/R_at_CSAN/index.html](https://jtsuvile.github.io/R_at_CSAN/index.html).
